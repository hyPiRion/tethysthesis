Tethys Thesis is a LaTeX template for computer science theses and project
documentation.

## Introduction

**NOTE: Tethys Thesis is still not ready for production. Do not expect it to be
  stable.**

Tethys Thesis is a template heavily based upon my own workflow on projects and
LaTeX experience taylored towards computer scientists. It may not suit you, but
at least it suits me well.

Notable choices include:

* Bibliography is handled with biblatex, not bibtex
* For listings, Minted is used instead of lstlistings
* Running `make repeatedly` runs latexmk, making it easier to do "agile" LaTeX
  development
